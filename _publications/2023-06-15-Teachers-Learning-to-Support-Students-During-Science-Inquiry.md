abstract: "This paper analyzes two teachers’ participation in professional learning (PL) activities designed to help them learn to support students when they face uncertainty during a computationally-rich science inquiry unit and their subsequent enactments of the unit. In this unit, students assemble a physical computing system (PCS) coupled with sensors to program and display streams of environmental data. Students inevitably encountered moments when they were “stuck” and required teacher help. The PL activities consisted of teachers taking on “student-hat/teacher-hat” roles attempting to solve buggy PCSs followed by a discussion. Analyses using a lens on teaching as improvisation illustrated how PL activities helped teachers develop an understanding of the PCS, confidence in enacting the unit, and pedagogical strategies for making in-the-moment decisions to support students facing uncertainties. Analyses also revealed teachers’ approaches for managing students' uncertainty level and the improvisation it required: one more constraining and one more expansive."
