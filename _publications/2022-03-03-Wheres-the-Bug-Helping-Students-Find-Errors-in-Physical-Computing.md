abstract: "Popular platforms for teaching physical computing like the LilyPadArduino and Adafruit Circuit Playground have simplified program-ming and wiring, enabling students to quickly engineer physicalcomputing projects. But enabling students to rapidly design andbuild is a double-edged sword: Students can create functioningprototypes without fully understanding the underlying principles.With limited knowledge and experience, students struggle to locateand fix bugs, or errors, in their projects. Absent appropriate debug-ging tools, students rely on their instructor for locating errors, orworse, turn toward destructive tactics such as tearing apart andrebuilding their project, hoping the bug fixes itself. Students needtools targeted to their ability that scaffold debugging and help themlocate bugs in the mixed hardware/software environment of physi-cal computing. I developed Circuit Check to scaffold the debuggingprocess for students. It enables students to observe real-time sensordata and test hardware components through a novel adaptation ofthe traditional breakpoint for physical computing"
