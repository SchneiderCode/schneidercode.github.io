## Michael Schneider  

I am currently a Doctoral Student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am researching the development of debugging tools for embedded systems, specifically electronic textiles (e-textiles). Much of my work has focused on supporting novice engineers (end users, undergraduate students, middle/high school students) as they learn about designing circuits and writing code. 

I anticipate graduating in May 2024 with my PhD in CS and I am interested in Software Engineering jobs focused on tool development, web development, and/or embedded systems. I am also interested in positions where I can apply my teaching experience, where I can support others in software development
